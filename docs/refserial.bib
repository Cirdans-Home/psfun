abstract = {Expokit provides a set of routines aimed at computing matrix exponentials. More precisely, it computes either a small matrix exponential in full, the action of a large sparse matrix exponential on an operand vector, or the solution of a system of linear OBEs with  constant inhomogeneity. The backbone of the sparse routines consists of matrix-free Krylov subspace projection methods (Arnoldi and Lanczos processes), and that is why the toolkit is capable of coping with sparse matrices of large dimension. The software handles real and complex matrices and provides specific routines for symmetric and Hermitian matrices. The computation of matrix exponentials is a numerical issue of critical importance in the area of Markov chains and furthermore, the computed solution is subject to  probabilistic constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient states of Markov chains.},

abstract = {FORTRAN 95 software is provided for computing the matrix values of φ-functions required in exponential integrators. The subroutines in the library accept as their argument a full, diagonal, or upper quasitriangular matrix with real or complex entries in one of four precisions. Two different algorithms are implemented, one is the scaling and squaring method, and the other is a modified block Schur--Parlett algorithm. In the latter algorithm, a recursive three-by-three blocking is applied to the argument based on an estimate of the sep-inverse function. The estimation of the sep-inverse function is carried out by Hager--Higham estimator implemented as the subroutine xLACON in LAPACK. Our modifications to the block Schur--Parlett algorithm are described together with the results of numerical experiments.},
