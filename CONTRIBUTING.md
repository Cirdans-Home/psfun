# Contributing 

The library is currently in the early stages of development. There are many things to do, a list of the things I am working on can be found 
on the [PSFUN](https://github.com/users/Cirdans-Home/projects/1) project.

Parts of code that can definitely be useful are:

- methods for calculating matrix functions on small-format matrices and in dense storage. If you have implemented any 
of this in an open source way, let us know and we can discuss an integration,
- quadrature formulas for the approximation of Cauchy integrals.

If you have other ideas or want to collaborate, I'm an email away.
